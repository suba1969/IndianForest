        <font face="verdana" size=4 color="#114203">India is one of the First countries in the world to have stated
            scientific management of its forests. During the year 1864 the then British India Government started the
            Imperial Forest Department and appointed Dr.
            Dietrich Brandis, a German Forest officer Inspector General of Forests in 1866. Having recognized the need
            to have a
            premier forest service to mange the varied natural resources of the vast country and to organize the affairs
            of the Imperial Forest Department, Imperial Forest Service was constituted in 1867. Having realized the
            importance of a multi-tier forest Administration in the federal and provincial Governments for effective
            management of
            forest resources the British India Government also constituted Provincial Forest Service and Executive &
            Subordinate Services, which were quite similar to the present day forest administrative hierarchy.</font>

            the Maikal range of Satpuras in Madhya Pradesh, the heart of India that forms
            the central Indian highlands.The national park is being popularized as the Tiger reserve and interestingly
            is
            being declared as one of the finest wildlife areas in the world. Spreading across two revenue districts the
            Mandala and the Kalaghat, Kanha National Park was declared a reserve forest in 1879 and revalued as a
            wildlife
            sanctuary in 1933. Its position was further upgraded to a national park in 1955. The Kanha National Park is
            spread across the area of 940 sq km in the Maikal chain of hills. By bringing up the
            buffer and core zone all together, the Kanha Tiger Reserve has the total area of 1945 sq km. The landscapes
            and
            the surrounding luxurious meadows along with the wooded strands and the dense maroons of
            forests offer magnanimous sightseeing experiences for the nature lovers. Making the land more beautiful and
            adorable, the crystal clear streams amidst the dense jungle cleanses the surroundings and makes the wildlife
            unrivalled. This vivacious land has been the source of inspiration for Rudyard Kipling, a famous writer for
            his
            outstanding creation- “The Jungle Book”. The Kanha National Park is the ideal home for wide ranges of wild
            creatures; right from the mighty tigers to the
            most populated Barasingha and the countless species of plants, birds, reptiles and insects. This reserve has
            fascinated many travelers around the corners of the world with its well developed infrastructure specially
            meant
            for them. The best location here to enjoy the most is the Bammi Dadar, also known as the Sunset Point.
